<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">If</span> the general public, acquainted only with the comic works of <span class="smcap">Thomas
Hood</span>, were taken by surprise when they found how he could handle serious
and solemn themes; those who saw him in the flesh must have been equally
astonished to learn how grave and melancholy a man the famous wit was to
all appearance. The chronic ill health, which gave this expression to
his countenance, was, however, powerless to affect the tone of his mind.
“Here lies one who spat more blood and made more puns than any man
living,” was the epitaph he half-jestingly proposed for himself. The
connection between the disease and the comic faculty is not so
unreasonable as it appears at first. The invalid, who could supply mirth
for millions while he himself was propped up with pillows on the bed of
sickness, was not a jester whose sole stock in trade consisted in mere
animal spirits&mdash;which are too often mistaken for wit, but have in common
with other spirits a tendency to evaporate somewhat rapidly. <span class="smcap">Hood’s</span> wit
was the fruit of an even temperament, a cheery and contented mind
endowed with a keen appreciation of the ludicrous. This acute perception
of what is ludicrous is the foundation of all wit, but it may influence
the mind in two ways. It may render its possessor as indifferent to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span>feelings as it makes him alive to the failings of others. How often
does the wit, delighting in the flash and report of his jest, forget the
wound it may inflict!</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, the shrewd appreciation of the weaknesses of
others assists a kindly and well-balanced mind to avoid the infliction
of pain; and the wit of <span class="smcap">Thomas Hood</span> was of this nature. It was all the
brighter because it was never stained by a tear wantonly caused. Even
the temptations of practical joking&mdash;and they have a strong influence on
those who enjoy the comic side of things&mdash;never betrayed him into any
freak that could give pain. He worked away industriously with wood,
paint, and glue to send his friend <span class="smcap">Franck</span> a new and killing bait for the
early spring&mdash;a veritable <i>Poisson d’Avril</i>, constructed to come in
half after a brief immersion, and reveal the inscription, “Oh, you April
Fool!” He could gravely persuade his young wife, when she was first
learning the mysteries of housekeeping, that she must never purchase
plaice with red spots, for they were a proof that the fish were not
fresh. But he was incapable of any of the cruel pleasantries for which
<span class="smcap">Theodore Hook</span> was famous: indeed, the only person he ever frightened,
even, with a practical joke, was himself; when as a boy he traced with
the smoke of a candle on the ceiling of a passage outside his bedroom a
diabolical face, which was intended to startle his brother, but which so
alarmed the artist himself, when he was going to bed forgetful of his
own feat, that he ran down stairs&mdash;in a panic and in his
night-dress&mdash;into the presence of his father’s guests assembled in the
drawing-room. He used to enjoy so heartily and chuckle so merrily over
his innocent practical jokes and hoaxes (he was never more delighted
than when a friend of his was completely imposed on by a sham account of
a survey of the Heavens through Lord <span class="smcap">Rosse’s</span> “monster telescope”) that
the tenderness he showed for the feelings of others is more remarkable.
The same forbearance characterises his writings. In spite of many and
great provocations, he seldom, or never, wrote a bitter word, though
that he could have been severe is amply indicated in his “Ode to <span class="smcap">Rae
Wilson</span>,” or still more in certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span> letters on “Copyright and Copywrong,”
which he was spurred on by injustice and ill-usage to address to the
<i>Athenæum</i>. He was a Shandean, who carried out in his life as well as
his writings the principles which <span class="smcap">Sterne</span> confined to the latter.</p>

<p>The first appearance of <span class="smcap">Thomas Hood</span> as a comic writer was in the year
1826, when he published the First Series of “Whims and Oddities.” The
critics in many instances took offence at his puns, as might have been
expected, for his style was new and startling. His book was full of
word-play, and it is easy to conceive&mdash;as he wrote in his address to the
Second Edition&mdash;“how gentlemen with one idea were perplexed with a
double meaning.” However, the public approved if the critics did not,
and called for a second and soon after a third edition. Finally, after
the publication of a second series, a fourth issue, containing the two
series in one volume, was demanded. “Come what may,” said <span class="smcap">Hood</span>, “this
little book will now leave four imprints behind it&mdash;and a horse could do
no more!”</p>

<p>He had by this time commenced the Comic Annuals, a series which he
carried on for many years, and by which he established his fame as the
first wit and humourist of his day. When this publication ceased he
wrote first for <i>Colburn’s New Monthly</i>, of which he was appointed
Editor on <span class="smcap">Hook’s</span> death; and subsequently, and up to the time of his
death, in his own periodical, <i>Hood’s Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>Puns have been styled the lowest form of wit, and the critics have
fallen foul of them from time immemorial until the present day. But a
pun proper&mdash;and there should be a strict definition of a pun&mdash;is, it is
humbly submitted, of so complicated a nature as to be anything but a low
form of wit. A mere jingle of similar sounds, or a distortion of
pronunciation does not constitute a pun&mdash;a double meaning is essential
to its existence&mdash;a play of sense as well as of sound. That the latter
was in <span class="smcap">Hood’s</span> opinion the more important feature of the two is to be
inferred from his statement that “a pun is something like a cherry:
though there may be a slight outward indication of partition&mdash;of
duplicity of mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span>ing, yet no gentleman need make two bites at it
against his own pleasure.” In other words, the sense is complete without
any reference to the second meaning. Tested by this rule, the majority
of so-called puns, which have brought discredit on punning, would be
immediately condemned, the only excuse for the form in which they are
written being the endeavour to tack on a second meaning, or too often
only an echo of sound without meaning.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best defence of punning is to be found in the following
stanzas of “Miss Kilmansegg:”</p>

</div></div>

<p>The reputation of <span class="smcap">Thomas Hood</span> as a wit and humourist rests on his
writings chiefly. His recorded sayings are few, for in general society
he was shy and reserved, seldom making a joke, or doing it with so grave
a face that the witticism seemed an accident, and was in many cases
possibly allowed to pass unnoticed, for a great number of people do not
recognise a joke that is not prefaced by a jingle of the cap and bells.
When in the company of a few intimate friends, however, he was full of
fun and good spirits. Unfortunately, on such occasions the good things
were not “set in a note-book,” and so were for the most part lost;
though at times an anecdote, well-authenticated, turns up to make us
regret that more have not been preserved.</p>

<p>One such anecdote, which has not hitherto appeared in print, may not be
out of place here. <span class="smcap">Hood</span> and “<span class="smcap">Peter Priggins</span>”&mdash;the Rev. Mr. <span class="smcap">Hewlett</span>&mdash;went
on a visit to a friend of the latter’s, residing near Ramsgate. As they
drove out of the town they passed a board on which was printed in large
letters</p>

<p class="c">
BEWARE THE DOG.<br />
</p>

<p class="nind">A glance at the premises which the announcement was intended to guard
showed that the quadruped was not forthcoming, whereupon <span class="smcap">Hood</span> jumped out
of the gig, and, picking up a bit of chalk (plentiful enough in the
neighbourhood), wrote under the warning&mdash;</p>

<p class="c">
WARE BE THE DOG?<br />
</p>

<p>These introductory remarks cannot be better wound-up than by a quotation
from a preface to “<span class="smcap">Hood’s</span> Own,” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> which is laid down the system of
“Practical Cheerful Philosophy,” which is reflected in his writings, and
which influenced his life. The reader will more thoroughly appreciate
the comic writings of <span class="smcap">Thomas Hood</span> after its perusal:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the absence of a certain thin “blue and yellow” visage, and
attenuated figure,&mdash;whose effigies may one day be affixed to the
present work,&mdash;you will not be prepared to learn that some of the
merriest effusions in the forthcoming numbers have been the
relaxations of a gentleman literally enjoying bad health&mdash;the
carnival, so to speak, of a personified Jour Maigre. The very
fingers so aristocratically slender, that now hold the pen, hint
plainly of the “<i>ills</i> that <i>flesh</i> is heir to:”&mdash;my coats have
become great coats, my pantaloons are turned into trowsers, and, by
a worse bargain than Peter Schemihl’s, I seem to have retained my
shadow and sold my substance. In short, as happens to prematurely
old port wine, I am of a bad colour with very little body. But what
then? That emaciated hand still lends a hand to embody in words and
sketches the creations or recreations of a Merry Fancy: those gaunt
sides yet shake heartily as ever at the Grotesques and Arabesques
and droll Picturesques that my good Genius (a Pantagruelian
Familiar) charitably conjures up to divert me from more sombre
realities. It was the whim of a late pleasant Comedian, to suppose
a set of spiteful imps sitting up aloft, to aggravate all his petty
mundane annoyances; whereas I prefer to believe in the ministry of
kindlier Elves that “nod to me and do me courtesies.” Instead of
scaring away these motes in the sunbeam, I earnestly invoke them,
and bid them welcome; for the tricksy spirits make friends with the
animal spirits, and do not I, like a father romping with his own
urchins,&mdash;do not I forget half my cares whilst partaking in their
airy gambols? Such sports are as wholesome for the mind as the
other frolics for the body. For on our own treatment of that
excellent Friend or terrible Enemy the Imagination, it depends
whether we are to be scared and haunted by a Scratching Fanny, or
tended by an affectionate Invisible Girl&mdash;like an unknown Love,
blessing us with “favours secret, sweet, and precious,” and fondly
stealing us from this worky-day world to a sunny sphere of her own.</p>

<p>This is a novel version, Reader, of “Paradise and the Peri,” but it
is as true as it is new. How else could I have converted a serious
illness into a comic wellness&mdash;by what other agency could<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> I have
transported myself, as a Cockney would say, from <i>Dull</i>age to
<i>Grin</i>nage? It was far from a practical joke to be laid up in
ordinary in a foreign land, under the care of Physicians quite as
much abroad as myself with the case; indeed, the shades of the
gloaming were stealing over my prospect; but I resolved, that, like
the sun, so long as my day lasted, I would look on the bright side
of everything. The raven croaked, but I persuaded myself that it
was the nightingale! there was the smell of the mould, but I
remembered that it nourished the violets. However my body might cry
craven, my mind luckily had no mind to give in. So, instead of
mounting on the black long-tailed coach horse, she vaulted on her
old Hobby that had capered in the Morris-Dance, and began to exhort
from its back. To be sure, said she, matters look darkly enough;
but the more need for the lights. Allons! Courage! Things may take
a turn, as the pig said on the spit. Never throw down your cards,
but play out the game. The more certain to lose, the wiser to get
all the play you can for your money. Come&mdash;give us a song! chirp
away like that best of cricket-players, the cricket himself. Be
bowled out or caught out, but never throw down the bat. As to
Health, it’s the weather of the body&mdash;it hails, it rains, it blows,
it snows, at present, but it may clear up by-and-bye. You cannot
eat, you say, and you must not drink; but laugh and make believe,
like the Barber’s wise brother at the Barmecide’s feast. Then, as
to thinness, not to flatter, you look like a lath that has had a
split with the carpenter and a fall out with the plaster; but so
much the better: remember how the smugglers trim the sails of the
lugger to escape the notice of the cutter. Turn your edge to the
old enemy, and mayhap he won’t see you! Come&mdash;be alive! You have no
more right to slight your life than to neglect your wife&mdash;they are
the two better halves that make a man of you! Is not life your
means of living? So stick to thy business, and thy business will
stick to thee. Of course, continued my mind, I am quite
disinterested in this advice&mdash;for I am aware of my own
immortality&mdash;but for that very reason, take care of the mortal
body, poor body, and give it as long a day as you can.</p>

<p>Now, my mind seeming to treat the matter very pleasantly as well as
profitably, I followed her counsel, and instead of calling out for
relief according to the fable, I kept along on my journey, with my
bundle of sticks,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, my arms and legs. Between ourselves, it
would have been “extremely inconvenient,” as I once heard the
opium-eater declare, to pay the debt of nature at that particular
juncture; nor do I quite know, to be candid, when it would
altogether suit me to settle it, so, like other persons in nar<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span>row
circumstances, I laughed, and gossipped, and played the agreeable
with all my might, and as such pleasant behaviour sometimes obtains
a respite from a human creditor, who knows but that it may prove
successful with the Universal Mortgagee? At all events, here I am,
humming “Jack’s Alive!” and my own dear skilful native physician
gives me hopes of a longer lease than appeared from the foreign
reading of the covenants. He declares, indeed, that, anatomically,
my heart is lower hung than usual&mdash;but what of that? <i>The more need
to keep it up!</i></p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> new issue of <span class="smcap">Hood’s</span> Poems has been completely revised, and will be
found not only larger in size, but far richer in contents, than any
previous edition. This, with the companion volume of “Serious Poems,”
will be found to contain <i>the entire poetical works of Thomas Hood</i>. The
volume has been, moreover, enriched by the addition of a large number of
the highly humorous illustrations, in which Thomas Hood’s comic power
was displayed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;There is an anecdote of a Scotch Professor who happened
during a Sunday walk to be hammering at a geological specimen which
he had picked up, when a peasant gravely accosted him, and said,
very seriously, “Eh! Sir, you think you are only breaking a stone,
but you are breaking the Sabbath.”</p>

<p>In a similar spirit, some of our over-righteous sectarians are fond
of attributing all breakage to the same cause&mdash;from the smashing of
a parish lamp, up to the fracture of a human skull;&mdash;the “breaking
into the bloody house of life,” or the breaking into a brick-built
dwelling. They all originate in the breaking of the Sabbath. It is
the source of every crime in the country&mdash;the parent of every
illegitimate child in the parish. The picking of a pocket is
ascribed to the picking of a daisy&mdash;the robbery on the highway to a
stroll in the fields&mdash;the incendiary fire to a hot dinner&mdash;on
Sunday. All other causes&mdash;the want of education&mdash;the want of moral
culture&mdash;the want of bread itself, are totally repudiated. The
criminal himself is made to confess at the gallows that he owes his
appearance on the scaffold to a walk with “Sally in our alley” on
the “day that comes between a Saturday and Monday.”</p>

<p>Supposing this theory to be correct, and made like the law “for
every degree,” the wonder of Captain Macheath that we haven’t
“better company at Tyburn tree” (now the New Drop) must be fully
shared by everybody who has visited the Ring in Hyde Park on the
day in question. But how much greater must be the wonder of any
person who has happened to reside, like myself, for a year or two
in a continental city, inhabited, according to the strict
construction of our Mawworms, by some fifteen or twenty thousand of
habitual Sabbath-breakers, and yet, without hearing of murder and
robbery as often as of blood-sausages and dollars! A city where the
Burgomaster himself must have come to a bad end, if a dance upon
Sunday led so inevitably to a dance upon nothing!</p>

<p>The “saints” having set up this absolute dependence of crime on
Sabbath-breaking, their relative proportions become a fair
statistical question; and, as such, the inquiry is seriously
recommended to the rigid legislator, who acknowledges, indeed, that
the Sabbath was “made for man,” but, by a singular interpretation,
conceives that the man for whom it was made is himself!</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span></p>

<span class="ih">That part of Holborn christened High,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a loud and sudden cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That chill’d my very blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! from out a dirty alley,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where pigs and Irish wont to rally,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a crazy woman sally,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bedaub’d with grease and mud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turn’d her East, she turn’d her West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staring like Pythoness possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With streaming hair and heaving breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one stark mad with grief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way and that she wildly ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jostling with woman and with man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her right hand held a frying pan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The left a lump of beef.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last her frenzy seem’d to reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A point just capable of speech,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Oh Lord! oh dear, my heart will break, I shall go stick stark staring wild!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has ever a one seen anything about the streets like a crying lost-looking child?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lawk help me, I don’t know where to look, or to run, if I only knew which way&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A child as is lost about London streets, and especially Seven Dials, is a needle in a bottle of hay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am all in a quiver&mdash;get out of my sight, do, you wretch, you little Kitty M’Nab!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You promised to have half an eye on him, you know you did, you dirty deceitful young drab.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last time as ever I see him, poor thing, was with my own blessed Motherly eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sitting as good as gold in the gutter, a playing at making little dirt pies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder he left the court where he was better off than all the other young boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With two bricks, an old shoe, nine oyster-shells, and a dead kitten by way of toys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his father comes home, and he always comes home as sure as ever the clock strikes one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’ll be rampant, he will, at his child being lost; and the beef and the inguns not done!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La bless you, good folks, mind your own consarns, and don’t be making a mob in the street;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Serjeant M’Farlane! you have not come across my poor little boy, have you, in your beat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do, good people, move on! don’t stand staring at me like a parcel of stupid stuck pigs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saints forbid! but he’s p’r’aps been inviggled away up a court for the sake of his clothes by the prigs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’d a very good jacket, for certain, for I bought it myself for a shilling one day in Rag Fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his trousers considering not very much patch’d, and red plush, they was once his Father’s best pair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shirt, it’s very lucky I’d got washing in the tub, or that might have gone with the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he’d got on a very good pinafore with only two slits and a burn on the breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’d a goodish sort of hat, if the crown was sew’d in, and not quite so much jagg’d at the brim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one shoe on, and the other shoe is a boot, and not a fit, and you’ll know by that if it’s him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except being so well dress’d my mind would misgive, some old beggar woman in want of an orphan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had borrow’d the child to go a begging with, but I’d rather see him laid out in his coffin!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do, good people, move on, such a rabble of boys! I’ll break every bone of ’em I come near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go home&mdash;you’re spilling the porter&mdash;go home&mdash;Tommy Jones, go along home with your beer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day is the sorrowfullest day of my life, ever since my name was Betty Morgan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them vile Savoyards! they lost him once before all along of following a Monkey and an Organ.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh my Billy&mdash;my head will turn right round&mdash;if he’s got kiddynapp’d with them Italians,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’ll make him a plaster parish image boy, they will, the outlandish tatterdemalions.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Billy&mdash;where are you, Billy?&mdash;I’m as hoarse as a crow, with screaming for ye, you young sorrow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shan’t have half a voice, no more I shan’t, for crying fresh herrings to-morrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Billy, you’re bursting my heart in two, and my life won’t be of no more vally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I’m to see other folks’ darlins, and none of mine, playing like angels in our alley.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what shall I do but cry out my eyes, when I looks at the old three-legged chair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Billy used to make coach and horses of, and there an’t no Billy there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would run all the wide world over to find him, if I only know’d where to run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little Murphy, now I remember, was once lost for a month through stealing a penny bun,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord forbid of any child of mine! I think it would kill me raily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find my Bill holdin’ up his little innocent hand at the Old Bailey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though I say it as oughtn’t, yet I will say, you may search for miles and mileses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not find one better brought up, and more pretty behaved, from one end to t’other of St. Giles’s.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if I call’d him a beauty, it’s no lie, but only as a Mother ought to speak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You never set eyes on a more handsomer face, only it hasn’t been wash’d for a week;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for hair, tho’ it’s red, it’s the most nicest hair when I’ve time to just show it the comb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll owe ’em five pounds, and a blessing besides, as will only bring him safe and sound home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s blue eyes, and not to be call’d a squint, though a little cast he’s certainly got;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his nose is still a good un, tho’ the bridge is broke, by his falling on a pewter pint pot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s got the most elegant wide mouth in the world, and very large teeth for his age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quite as fit as Mrs. Murdockson’s child to play Cupid on the Drury Lane Stage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he has got such dear winning ways&mdash;but oh I never never shall see him no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O dear! to think of losing him just after nursing him back from death’s door!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the very last month when the windfalls, hang ’em, was at twenty a penny!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the threepence he’d got by grottoing was spent in plums, and sixty for a child is too many.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Cholera man came and whitewash’d us all and, drat him, made a seize of our hog.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s no use to send the Crier to cry him about, he’s such a blunderin’ drunken old dog;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last time he was fetch’d to find a lost child, he was guzzling with his bell at the Crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went and cried a boy instead of a girl, for a distracted Mother and Father about Town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Billy&mdash;where are you, Billy, I say? come Billy, come home, to your best of Mothers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m scared when I think of them Cabroleys, they drive so, they’d run over their own Sisters and Brothers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or may be he’s stole by some chimbly sweeping wretch, to stick fast in narrow flues and what not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be poked up behind with a picked pointed pole, when the soot has ketch’d, and the chimbly’s red hot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh I’d give the whole wide world, if the world was mine, to clap my two longin’ eyes on his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he’s my darlin of darlins, and if he don’t soon come back, you’ll see me drop stone dead on the place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only wish I’d got him safe in these two Motherly arms, and wouldn’t I hug him and kiss him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lauk! I never knew what a precious he was&mdash;but a child don’t not feel like a child till you miss him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why there he is! Punch and Judy hunting, the young wretch, it’s that Billy as sartin as sin!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let me get him home, with a good grip of his hair, and I’m blest if he shall have a whole bone in his skin!”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well, here’s a pretty go! here’s a Gagging Act, if ever there was a gagging!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I’m bound the members as silenced us, in doing it had plenty of magging.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had better send us all off, they had, to the School for the Deaf and Dumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To unlarn us our mother tongues, and to make signs and be regularly mum.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they can’t undo natur&mdash;as sure as ever the morning begins to peep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Directly I open my eyes, I can’t help calling out Sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As natural as the sparrows among the chimbley-pots that say Cheep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my own part I find my suppress’d voice very uneasy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And comparable to nothing but having your tissue stopt when you are sneezy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, it’s all up with us! tho’ I suppose we mustn’t cry all up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here’s a precious merry Christmas, I’m blest if I can earn either bit or sup!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If crying Sweep, of mornings, is going beyond quietness’s border,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them as pretends to be fond of silence oughtn’t to cry hear, hear, and order, order.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder Mr. Sutton, as we’ve sut-on too, don’t sympathise with us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a Speaker what don’t speak, and that’s exactly our own cus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God help us if we don’t not cry, how are we to pursue our callings?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m sure we’re not half so bad as other businesses with their bawlings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For instance, the general postmen, that at six o’clock go about ringing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wake up all the babbies that their mothers have just got to sleep with singing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greens oughtn’t to be cried no more than blacks&mdash;to do the unpartial job,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they bring in a Sooty Bill, they ought to have brought in a Dusty Bob.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a dustman’s voice more sweet than ourn, when he comes a seeking arter the cinders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of a little boy like a blackbird in spring, singing merrily under your windows?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s the omnibus cads as plies in Cheapside, and keeps calling out Bank and City;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let his Worship, the Mayor, decide if our call of Sweep is not just as pretty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can’t see why the Jews should be let go about crying Old Close thro’ their hooky noses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Christian laws should be ten times more hard than the old stone laws of Moses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why isn’t the mouths of the muffin-men compell’d to be equally shut?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, because Parliament members eat muffins, but they never eat no sut.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next year there won’t be any May-day at all, we shan’t have no heart to dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jack in the Green will go in black like mourning for our mischance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we live as long as May, that’s to say, through the hard winter and pinching weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I don’t see how we’re to earn enough to keep body and soul together.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only wish Mr. Wilberforce or some of them that pities the niggers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would take a peep down in our cellars, and look at our miserable starving figures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-sitting idle on our empty sacks, and all ready to eat each other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a brood of little ones crying for bread to a heart-breaking Father and Mother.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They haven’t a rag of clothes to mend, if their mothers had thread and needles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But crawl naked about the cellars, poor things, like a swarm of common black beadles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they’d only inquired before passing the Act and taken a few such peeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don’t think that any real gentleman would have set his face against sweeps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Climbin’s an ancient respectable art, and if History’s of any vally,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was recommended by Queen Elizabeth to the great Sir Walter Raleigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he wrote on a pane of glass how I’d climb, if the way I only knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she writ beneath, if your heart’s afeard, don’t venture up the flue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for me I was always loyal, and respected all powers that are higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how can I now say God save the King, if I an’t to be a Cryer?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s London milk, that’s one of the cries, even on Sunday the law allows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ought black sweeps, that are human beasts, to be worser off than black cows?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do <i>we</i> go calling about, when it’s church time, like the noisy Billingsgate vermin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And disturb the parson with “All alive O!” in the middle of a funeral sermon?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fish won’t keep, not the mackarel won’t, is the cry of the Parliament elves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every thing, except the sweeps I think, is to be allowed to keep themselves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord help us! what’s to become of us if we mustn’t cry no more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shan’t do for black mutes to go a standing at a death’s door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we shan’t do to emigrate, no not even to the Hottentot nations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as time wears on, our black will wear off, and then think of our situations!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we should not do, in lieu of black-a-moor footmen, to serve ladies of quality nimbly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when we’re drest in our sky-blue and silver, and large frills, all<br />
clean and neat, and white silk stockings, if they pleased to<br />
desire us to sweep the hearth, we couldn’t resist the chimbley.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Will furnish with afflictions sore and marble urns and cherubims very low and reasonable.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a cage, comfortable enough; I’ve been in it with Old Jack Jeffrey and Tom Pike;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Green Man next door will send you in ale, gin, or any thing else you like.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can’t speak of the stocks, as nothing remains of them but the upright post;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the pound is kept in repairs for the sake of Cob’s horse, as is always there almost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a smithy of course, where that queer sort of a chap in his way, Old Joe Bradley,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perpetually hammers and stammers, for he stutters and shoes horses very badly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a shop of all sorts, that sells every thing, kept by the widow of Mr. Task;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when you go there it’s ten to one she’s out of every thing you ask.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll know her house by the swarm of boys, like flies, about the old sugary cask.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are six empty houses, and not so well paper’d inside as out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For bill-stickers won’t beware, but sticks notices of sales and election placards all about.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That’s the Doctor’s with a green door, where the garden pots in the windows is seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A weakly monthly rose that don’t blow, and a dead geranium, and a tea-plant with five black leaves and one green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for hollyoaks at the cottage doors, and honeysuckles and jasmines, you may go and whistle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Tailor’s front garden grow two cabbages, a dock, a ha’porth of pennyroyal, two dandelions, and a thistle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are three small orchards&mdash;Mr. Busby’s the schoolmaster’s is the chief&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With two pear-trees that don’t bear; one plum and an apple, that every year is stripp’d by a thief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s another small day-school too, kept by the respectable Mrs. Gaby;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A select establishment, for six little boys and one big, and four little girls and a baby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a rectory, with pointed gables and strange old chimneys that never smokes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the rector don’t live on his living like other Christian sort of folks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a barber’s once a week well filled with rough black-bearded shock-headed churls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a window with two feminine men’s heads, and two masculine ladies in false curls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a butcher’s and a carpenter’s and a plumber’s and a small green-grocer’s, and a baker<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he won’t bake on a Sunday, and there’s a sexton that’s a coal-merchant besides, and an undertaker;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a toy-shop, but not a whole one, for a village can’t compare with the London shops;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One window sells drums, dolls, kites, carts, bats, Clout’s balls, and the other sells malt and hops.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mrs. Brown, in domestic economy not to be a bit behind her betters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lets her house to a milliner, a watchmaker, a rat-catcher, a cobbler, lives in it herself, and it’s the post-office for letters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I’ve gone through all the village&mdash;ay, from end to end, save and except one more house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I haven’t come to that&mdash;and I hope I never shall&mdash;and that’s the Village Poor-House!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bunce stares up at the moon, next looking level,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Another scuffle of its usual brevity,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Doctor Oddy, in his suit of black,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Some likeness in the face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“So death at last has taken old Bombastic!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the very middle of his joking,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>subject</i>, still unconscious of the scoff&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seized all at once with a bad fit of choking,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Subjects are scarce, and when you get another,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To treat the Faculty like ducks and drakes,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Ev’n words malicious,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Glad was he to perceive, beside a wicket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A porter, ornamented with a ticket,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who did not seem to be at all too busy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">“Here, my good man,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Just show me, if you can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A doctor’s&mdash;if you want to earn a tizzy!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away the porter marches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with grave face, obsequious precedes him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down crooked lanes, round corners, under arches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, up an old-fashion’d staircase leads him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost impervious to the morning ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shows a door&mdash;“There, that’s a doctor’s reckon’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rare Top-Sawyer, let who will come second&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Good day.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He gropes his way into a dingy room,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Well&mdash;eh?&mdash;Who? What?&mdash;Speak out at once!”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Yes,&mdash;yes,&mdash;odd zounds!&mdash;I <i>am</i> a Doctor, fellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">At law!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The word sufficed.&mdash;Of things Bunce feared the most<br /></span>

alt="G"
width="50" /></span>OOD morning, Mr. What-d’ye-call! Well! here’s another pretty job!<br /></span>
<span class="ih">Lord help my Lady!&mdash;what a smash!&mdash;if you had only heard her sob!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was all through Mr. Lambert: but for certain he was winey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think for to go to sit down on a table full of Chiney.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Deuce take your stupid head!” says my Lady to his very face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But politeness, you know, is nothing, when there’s Chiney in the case;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if ever a woman was fond of Chiney to a passion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s my mistress, and all sorts of it, whether new or old fashion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her brother’s a sea-captain, and brings her home shiploads&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such bonzes, and such dragons, and nasty, squatting things like toads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great nidnoddin’ mandarins, with palsies in the head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I declare I’ve often dreamt of them, and had nightmares in my bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the frightfuller they are&mdash;lawk! she loves them all the better:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She’d have Old Nick himself made of Chiney if they’d let her.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lawk-a-mercy! break her Chiney, and it’s breaking her very heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I touch’d it, she would very soon say, “Mary, we must part.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be sure she <i>is</i> unlucky: only Friday comes Master Randall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breaks a broken spout, and fresh chips a tea-cup handle:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s a dear, sweet little child, but he will so finger and touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that’s why my Lady doesn’t take to children much.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well! there’s stupid Mr. Lambert, with his two great coat flaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must go and sit down on the Dresden shepherdesses’ laps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if there was no such things as rosewood chairs in the room;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I couldn’t have made a greater sweep with the handle of the broom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mercy on us! how my mistress began to rave and tear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well! after all, there’s nothing like good ironstone ware for wear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever I marry, that’s flat, I’m sure it won’t be John Dockery,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should be a wretched woman in a shop full of crockery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should never like to wipe it, though I love to be neat and tidy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And afraid of mad bulls on market-days every Monday and Friday.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m very much mistook if Mr. Lambert’s will be a catch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breaking the Chiney will be the breaking-off of his own match.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Missis wouldn’t have an angel, if he was careless about Chiney;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She never forgives a chip, if it’s ever so small and tiny.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lawk! I never saw a man in all my life in such a taking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could find in my heart to pity him for all his mischief-making.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see him stand a-hammering and stammering, like a zany;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what signifies apologies, if they won’t mend old Chaney!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he sent her up whole crates full, from Wedgwood’s and Mr. Spode’s,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He couldn’t make amends for the crack’d mandarins and smash’d toads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well! every one has their tastes, but, for my part, my own self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’d rather have the figures on my poor dear grandmother’s old shelf:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nice pea-green poll-parrot, and two reapers with brown ears of corns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a shepherd with a crook after a lamb with two gilt horns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such a Jemmy Jessamy in top boots and sky-blue vest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a frill and flower’d waistcoat, with a fine bowpot at the breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God help her, poor old soul! I shall come into ’em at her death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though she’s a hearty woman for her years, except her shortness of breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well! you think the things will mend&mdash;if they won’t, Lord mend us all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Lady will go in fits, and Mr. Lambert won’t need to call:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll be bound in any money, if I had a guinea to give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He won’t sit down again on Chiney the longest day he has to live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor soul! I only hope it won’t forbid his bans of marriage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or he’d better have sat behind on the spikes of my Lady’s carriage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you’ll join ’em all of course, and stand poor Mr. Lambert’s friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll look in twice a day, just to see, like, how they mend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be sure it is a sight that might draw tears from dogs and cats;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here’s this pretty little pagoda, now, has lost four of its cocked hats:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be particular with the pagoda: and then here’s this pretty bowl&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Chinese Prince is making love to nothing because of this hole;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here’s another Chinese man, with a face just like a doll&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do stick his pigtail on again, and just mend his parasol.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I needn’t tell you what to do; only do it out of hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And charge whatever you like to charge&mdash;my Lady won’t make a stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well! good morning, Mr. What-d’ye-call; for it’s time our gossip ended:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you know the proverb, the less as is said, the sooner the Chiney’s mended.<br /></span>

<span class="ig"><span class="letra"><img src="images/i-w.jpg"
alt="W"
width="50" /></span>ELL, the country’s a pleasant place, sure enough, for people that’s country born,<br /></span>
<span class="ih">And useful, no doubt, in a natural way, for growing our grass and our corn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was kindly meant of my cousin Giles, to write and invite me down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ as yet all I’ve seen of a pastoral life only makes me more partial to town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At first I thought I was really come down into all sorts of rural bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Porkington Place, with its cows and its pigs, and its poultry, looks not much amiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s something about a dairy farm, with its different kinds of live stock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That puts one in mind of Paradise, and Adam, and his innocent flock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But somehow the good old Elysium fields have not been well handed down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as yet I have found no fields to prefer to dear Leicester Fields up in town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To be sure it is pleasant to walk in the meads, and so I should like for miles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it wasn’t for clodpoles of carpenters that put up such crooked stiles;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the bars jut out, and you must jut out, till you’re almost broken in two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you clamber you’re certain sure of a fall, and you stick if you try to creep through.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of course, in the end, one learns how to climb without constant tumbles-down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still as to walking so stylishly, it’s pleasanter done about town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a way, I know, to avoid the stiles, and that’s by a walk in a lane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I did find a very nice shady one, but I never dared go again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who should I meet but a rampaging bull, that wouldn’t be kept in the pound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trying to toss the whole world at once, by sticking his horns in the ground?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that, by-the-bye, is another thing, that pulls rural pleasures down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev’ry day in the country is cattle-day, and there’s only two up in town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I’ve rose with the sun, to go brushing away at the first early pearly dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to meet Aurory, or whatever’s her name, and I always got wetted through;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My shoes are like sops, and I caught a bad cold, and a nice draggle-tail to my gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That’s not the way that we bathe our feet, or wear our pearls, up in town!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for picking flowers, I have tried at a hedge, sweet eglantine roses to snatch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, mercy on us! how nettles will sting, and how the long brambles do scratch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside hitching my hat on a nasty thorn that tore all the bows from the crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One may walk long enough without hats branching off, or losing one’s bows about town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But worse than that, in a long rural walk, suppose that it blows up for rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all at once you discover yourself in a real St. Swithin’s Lane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while you’re running all duck’d and drown’d, and pelted with sixpenny drops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Fine weather,” you hear the farmers say; “a nice growing shower for the crops!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who’s to crop me another new hat, or grow me another new gown?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you can’t take a shilling fare with a plough as you do with the hackneys in town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then my nevys too, they must drag me off to go with them gathering nuts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we always set out by the longest way and return by the shortest cuts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short cuts, indeed! But it’s nuts to them, to get a poor lustyish aunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scramble through gaps, or jump over a ditch, when they’re morally certain she can’t,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whenever I get in some awkward scrape, and it’s almost daily the case,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ they don’t laugh out, the mischievous brats, I see the “hooray!” in their face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">{146}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s the other day, for my sight is short, and I saw what was green beyond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought it was all terry firmer and grass, till I walked in the duckweed pond:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or perhaps when I’ve pully-hauled up a bank they see me come launching down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As none but a stout London female can do as is come a first time out of town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then how sweet, some say, on a mossy bank a verdurous seat to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for my part I always found it a joy that brought a repentance behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the juicy grass with its nasty green has stained a whole breadth of my gown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when gowns are dyed, I needn’t say, it’s much better done up in town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for country fare, the first morning I came I heard such a shrill piece of work!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever since&mdash;and it’s ten days ago&mdash;we’ve lived upon nothing but pork;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One Sunday except, and then I turn’d sick, a plague take all countrified cooks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why didn’t they tell me, <i>before</i> I had dined, they made pigeon pies of the rooks?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the gooseberry wine, tho’ it’s pleasant when up, it doesn’t agree when it’s down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it served me right, like a gooseberry, fool to look for champagne out of town?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be sure cousin G. meant it all for the best when he started this pastoral plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his wife is a worthy domestical soul and she teaches me all that she can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as making of cheese, and curing of hams, but I’m sure that I never shall learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I’ve fetch’d more back-ache than butter as yet by chumping away at the churn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in making hay, tho’ it’s tanning work, I found it more easy to make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it tries one’s legs, and no great relief when you’re tired to sit down on the rake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’d a country dance, too, at harvest home, with a regular country clown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Lord! they don’t hug one round the waist and give one such smacks in town:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I’ve tried to make friends with the birds and the beasts, but they take to such curious rigs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m always at odds with the turkey-cock, and I can’t even please the pigs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very hens pick holes in my hand when I grope for the new-laid eggs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gander comes hissing out of the pond on purpose to flap at my legs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ve been bump’d in a ditch by the cow without horns, and the old sow trampled me down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beasts are as vicious as any wild beasts&mdash;but they’re kept in cages in town!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another thing is the nasty dogs&mdash;thro’ the village I hardly can stir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since giving a bumpkin a pint of beer just to call off a barking cur;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now you would swear all the dogs in the place were set on to hunt me down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But neither the brutes nor the people I think are as civilly bred as in town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last night about twelve I was scared broad awake, and all in a tremble of fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But instead of a family murder it proved an owl, that flies screeching at night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then there’s plenty of ricks and stalks all about, and I can’t help dreaming of Swing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In short, I think that a pastoral life is not the most happiest thing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, besides all the troubles I’ve mentioned before, as endured for rurality’s sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ve been stung by the bees, and I’ve set among ants, and once&mdash;ugh! I trod on a snake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as to mosquitoes, they tortured me so, for I’ve got a particular skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do think it’s the gnats coming out of the ponds, that drives the poor suicides in!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after all an’t there new-laid eggs to be had upon Holborn Hill?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">{148}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dairy-fed pork in Broad St. Giles, and fresh butter wherever you will?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a covered cart that brings Cottage Bread quite rustical-like and brown?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So one isn’t so very uncountrified in the very heart of the town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howsomever my mind’s made up, and although I’m sure cousin Giles will be vext,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean to book me an inside place up to town upon Saturday next,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if nothing happens, soon after ten, I shall be at the Old Bell and Crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perhaps I may come to the country again, when London is all burnt down.<br /></span>

alt="M"
width="50" /></span>R. WALTON, it’s harsh to say it, but as a Parent I can’t help wishing<br /></span>
<span class="ih">You’d been hung before you publish’d your book, to set all the young people a fishing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s my Robert, the trouble I’ve had with him it surpasses a mortal’s bearing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all thro’ those devilish angling works&mdash;the Lord forgive me for swearing!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought he were took with the Morbus one day, I did with his nasty angle!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For “oh dear,” says he, and burst out in a cry, “oh my gut is all got of a tangle!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s a shame to teach a young boy such words&mdash;whose blood wouldn’t chill in their veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear him, as I overheard him one day, a-talking of blowing out brains?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And didn’t I quarrel with Sally the cook, and a precious scolding I give her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How dare you,” says I, “for to stench the whole house by keeping that stinking liver?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twas enough to breed a fever, it was! they smelt it next door at the Bagots’,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it wasn’t breeding no fever&mdash;not it! ’twas my son a breeding of maggots!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I declare that I couldn’t touch meat for a week, for it all seemed tainting and going,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after turning my stomach so, they turned to blueflies, all buzzing and blowing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boys are nasty enough, goodness knows, of themselves, without putting live things in their craniums;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, what next? but he pots a whole cargo of worms along with my choice geraniums.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And another fine trick, tho’ it wasn’t found out, till the housemaid had given us warning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fished at the golden fish in the bowl, before we were up and down in the morning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m sure it was lucky for Ellen, poor thing, that she’d got so attentive a lover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As bring her fresh fish when the others deceas’d, which they did a dozen times over!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a whole new loaf was short! for I know, of course, when our bread goes faster,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I made a stir with the bill in my hand, and the man was sent off by his master;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, oh dear, I thought I should sink thro’ the earth, with the weight of my own reproaches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my own pretty son had made away with the loaf, to make pastry to feed the roaches!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I vow I’ve suffered a martyrdom&mdash;with all sorts of frights and terrors surrounded!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I never saw him go out of the doors but I thought he’d come home to be drownded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sure enough, I set out one fine Monday to visit my married daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there he was standing at Sadler’s Wells, a-performing with real water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s well he was off on the further side, for I’d have brain’d him else with my patten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I thought he was safe at school, the young wretch! a studying Greek and Latin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my ridicule basket he had got on his back, to carry his fishes and gentles;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a belt I knew he’d made from the belt of his father’s regimentals&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, I poked his rods and lines in the fire, and his father gave him a birching,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he’d gone too far to be easy cured of his love for chubbing and perching.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One night he never came home to tea, and altho’ it was dark and dripping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father set off to Wapping, poor man! for the boy had a turn for shipping;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for me I set up, and I sobbed and I cried for all the world like a babby,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at twelve o’clock he rewards my fears with two gudging from Waltham Abbey!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a pretty sore throat and fever he caught, that brought me a fortnight’s hard nussing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I thought I should go to my grey-hair’d grave, worn out with the fretting and fussing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at last he was cur’d, and we did have hopes that the fishing was cured as well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no such luck! not a week went by before we’d have another such spell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ he never had got a penny to spend, for such was our strict intentions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he was soon set up in tackle agin, for all boys have such quick inventions:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I lost my Lady’s Own Pocket Book, in spite of all my hunting and poking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I found it chuck full of tackles and hooks, and besides it had got a good soaking.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then one Friday morning, I gets a summoning note from a sort of a law attorney,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the boy had been trespassing people’s grounds while his father was gone a journey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I had to go and hush it all up by myself, in an office at Hatton Garden;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to pay for the damage he’d done, to boot, and to beg some strange gentleman’s pardon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wasn’t he once fished out himself, and a man had to dive to find him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I saw him brought home with my motherly eyes and a mob of people behind him?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, it took a full hour to rub him to life&mdash;whilst I was a-screaming and raving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a couple of guineas it cost us besides, to reward the humane man for his saving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And didn’t Miss Crump leave us out of her will, all along of her taking dudgeon?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At her favourite cat being chok’d, poor Puss, with a hook sow’d up in a gudgeon?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And old Brown complain’d that he pluck’d his live fowls, and not without show of reason,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the cocks looked naked about necks and tails, and it wasn’t their moulting season;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sure and surely, when we came to enquire, there was cause for their screeching and cackles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the mischief confess’d he had picked them a bit, for I think he called them the hackles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pretty tussle we had about that! but as if it wasn’t picking enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the winter comes on, to the muff-box I goes, just to shake out my sable muff&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O mercy!” thinks I, “there’s the moth in the house!” for the fur was all gone in patches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then at Ellen’s chinchilly I look, and its state of destruction just matches<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">{221}</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it wasn’t no moth, Mr. Walton, but flies&mdash;sham flies to go trolling and trouting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his father’s great coat was all safe and sound, and that first set me a-doubting.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A plague, say I, on all rods and lines, and on young or old watery danglers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after all that you’ll talk of such stuff as no harm in the world about anglers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when all is done, all our worry and fuss, why, we’ve never had nothing worth dishing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So you see, Mister Walton, no good comes at last of your famous book about fishing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for Robert’s, I burnt it a twelvemonth ago; but it turned up too late to be lucky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he’d got it by heart, as I found to the cost of<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Your servant,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To flaunt it in the sun!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turn’d, and look’d at the beggar man,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="THE_BALLAD_OF" id="THE_BALLAD_OF"></a>THE BALLAD OF<br /><br />
“SALLY BROWN AND BEN THE CARPENTER.”</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind"><small>I <span class="smcap">have</span> never been vainer of any verses than of my part in the
following Ballad. Dr. Watts, amongst evangelical nurses, has an
enviable renown&mdash;and Campbell’s Ballads enjoy a snug genteel
popularity. “Sally Brown” has been favoured, perhaps, with as wide
a patronage as the Moral Songs, though its circle may not have been
of so select a class as the friends of “Hohenlinden.” But I do not
desire to see it amongst what are called Elegant Extracts. The
lamented Emery, drest as Tom Tug, sang it at his last mortal
Benefit at Covent Garden;&mdash;and, ever since, it has been a great
favourite with the watermen of Thames, who time their oars to it,
as the wherry-men of Venice time theirs to the lines of Tasso. With
the watermen, it went naturally to Vauxhall:&mdash;and, over land, to
Sadler’s Wells. The Guards, not the mail coach, but the Life
Guards,&mdash;picked it out from a fluttering hundred of others&mdash;all
going to one air&mdash;against the dead wall at Knightsbridge. Cheap
Printers of Shoe Lane, and Cowcross, (all pirates!) disputed about
the Copyright, and published their own editions,&mdash;and, in the
meantime, the Authors, to have made bread of their song, (it was
poor old Homer’s hard ancient case!) must have sung it about the
streets. Such is the lot of Literature! the profits of “Sally
Brown” were divided by the Ballad Mongers:&mdash;it has cost, but has
never brought me, a half-penny.</small></p></div>

<span class="i0">“We was both, Ma’am, in the wash-house, Ma’am, a-standing at our tubs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mrs. Round was seconding what little things I rubs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Mary,’ says she to me, ‘I say’&mdash;and there she stops for coughin’,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘That dratted copper flue has took to smokin’ very often,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But please the pigs,’&mdash;for that’s her way of swearing in a passion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘I’ll blow it up, and not be set a-coughin’ in this fashion!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, down she takes my master’s horn&mdash;I mean his horn for loading,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And empties every grain alive for to set the flue exploding.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lawk, Mrs. Round! says I, and stares, that quantum is unproper.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m sartin sure it can’t not take a pound to sky a copper;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll powder both our heads off, so I tells you, with its puff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she only dried her fingers, and she takes a pinch of snuff.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, when the pinch is over&mdash;‘Teach your grandmother to suck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A powder horn,’ says she&mdash;Well, says I, I wish you luck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them words sets up her back, so with her hands upon her hips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Come,’ says she, quite in a huff, ‘come, keep your tongue inside your lips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afore ever you was born, I was well used to things like these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall put it in the grate, and let it burn up by degrees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in it goes, and Bounce&mdash;O Lord! it gives us such a rattle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought we both were canonised, like Sogers in a battle!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up goes the copper like a squib, and us on both our backs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless the tubs, they bundled off, and split all into cracks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, there I fainted dead away, and might have been cut shorter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Providence was kind, and brought me to with scalding water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I first looks round for Mrs. Round, and sees her at a distance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As stiff as starch, and looked as dead as any thing in existence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All scorched and grimed, and more than that, I sees the copper slap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right on her head, for all the world like a percussion copper cap.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, I crooks her little fingers, and crumps them well up together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_410" id="page_410">{410}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well, she’ll wash no more in this world, whatever she does in t’other.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I gives myself to scramble up the linens for a minute,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh! I never, never, never, never, never see a sight so shockin’;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here lays a leg, and there a leg&mdash;I mean, you know, a stocking&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bodies all slit and torn to rags, and many a tattered skirt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And arms burnt off, and sides and backs all scotched and black with dirt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as nobody was in ’em&mdash;none but&mdash;nobody was hurt!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, there I am, a-scrambling up the things, all in a lump,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, mercy on us! such a groan as makes my heart to jump.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there she is, a-lying with a crazy sort of eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-staring at the wash-house roof, laid open to the sky:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she beckons with her finger, and so down to her I reaches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And puts my ear agin her mouth to hear her dying speeches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, poor soul! she has a husband and young orphans, as I knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, Ma’am, you won’t believe it, but it’s Gospel fact and true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But these words is all she whispered&mdash;‘Why, where <i>is</i> the powder blew!’<span class="lftspc">”</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And recal, with foul faces, the source of their want&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the sum of her suds might be summ’d in a bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rusty cold iron quite enter’d her soul&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, perhaps, the last glance of her wandering eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had caught “the Cock Laundresses’ Coach” going by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or her lines that hung idle, to waste the fine weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she thought of her wrongs and her rights both together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a lather of passion that froth’d as it rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too angry for grammar, too lofty for prose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her sheet&mdash;if a sheet were still left her&mdash;to write,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By Baron Hoggerhausen hunted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His back was up, and on its ledge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bristles rose like quickset hedge;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">A dirty fragment of a paper,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lying neglected on the ground;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_436" id="page_436">{436}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A relic of the Morning Post,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(Derived from Learned Toby’s line)<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He read, and mused, and pored and read,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now at a line he gave a grunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now at a phrase took sudden stunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snorting turn’d his back upon it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But always came again to con it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In short he petted up his passion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After a very human fashion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Temper’s worried with a bone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She’ll neither like nor let alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last his fury reach’d the pitch<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So stood the Boar, in furious mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made up for any thing but good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave his tail a tighter twist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As men in anger clench the fist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And threw fresh sparkles in his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the volcano in his fry&mdash;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">(For wits in madness never jump)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To liberate the beasts from Cross’s;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hiss at all the Wigs in Ross’s;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The snuff-men’s idols, ‘neath the gallows!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To one design&mdash;a battle royal.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">That came across him Whig or Tory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would have been a tragic story&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fortune interposing now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought Bessy into play&mdash;a Sow;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fat, sleek, philosophic beast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That never fretted in the least,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether her grains were sour or sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For grains are grains, and she could eat.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The farrow and the farinaceous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If cares she had, they could not stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She drank, and <i>wash’d</i> them all away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fact this philosophic sow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was very like a German frow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In brief&mdash;as wit should be and fun,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If sows turn Quakers, she was one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad from the duckpond, thick and slab,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A sprout of cabbage, green and raw,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For Peace, supports an olive branch,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her very grunt, so low and mild,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No ballad&mdash;worth a ha’penny&mdash;has ever come from either,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him as writ “Jim Crow,” he says, and got such lots of dollars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would make a better Chairman for the Glorious Apollers.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Howsomever that’s the meaning of the squabble that arouses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This neighbourhood, and quite disturbs all decent Heads of Houses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who want to have their dinners and their parties, as is reason<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Christian peace and charity according to the season.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from Number Thirty-Nine&mdash;since this electioneering job,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, as far as Number Ninety, there’s an everlasting mob;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the thing is quite a nuisance, for no creature passes by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he gets a card, a pamphlet, or a summut in his eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a pretty noise there is!&mdash;what with canvassers and spouters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in course each side is furnish’d with its backers and its touters;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And surely among the Clergy to such pitches it is carried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You can hardly find a Parson to get buried or get married;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or supposing any accident that suddenly alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you’re dying for a surgeon, you must fetch him from the “Arms;”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the Schoolmasters and Tooters are neglecting of their scholars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To write about a Chairman for the Glorious Apollers.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, that, sir, is the racket; and the more the sin and shame<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_452" id="page_452">{452}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of them that help to stir it up, and propagate the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of vocal ditties, and the social flowing cup,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they’ll be the House’s ruin, or the shutting of it up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their riots and their hubbubs, like a garden full of bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While they’ve damaged many articles and broken lots of squares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kept their noble Club Room in a perfect dust and smother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By throwing <i>Morning Heralds</i>, <i>Times</i>, and <i>Standards</i> at each other;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to name the ugly language Gemmen oughtn’t to repeat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the names they call each other&mdash;for I’ve heard ’em in the street&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as Traitors, Guys, and Judases, and Vipers, and what not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Pasley and his divers ain’t so blowing-up a lot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then such awful swearing!&mdash;for there’s one of them that cusses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough to shock the cads that hang on opposition ‘busses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he cusses every member that’s agin him at the poll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I wouldn’t cuss a donkey, tho’ it hasn’t got a soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cusses all their families, Jack, Harry, Bob or Jim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the babby in the cradle, if they don’t agree with him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereby, altho’ as yet they have not took to use their fives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, according as the fashion is, to sticking with their knives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m bound there’ll be some milling yet, and shakings by the collars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afore they choose a Chairman for the Glorious Apollers!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To be sure it is a pity to be blowing such a squall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of clouds, and every man his song, and then his call&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as if there wasn’t Whigs enough and Tories to fall out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides politics in plenty for our splits to be about,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, a Cornfield is sufficient, sir, as anybody knows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to furnish them in plenty who are fond of picking crows&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to name the Maynooth Catholics, and other Irish stews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To agitate society and loosen all its screws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And which all may be agreeable and proper to their spheres,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it’s not the thing for musicals to set us by the ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as to College larning, my opinion for to broach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I’ve had it from my cousin, and he driv a college coach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so knows the University, and all as there belongs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he says that Oxford’s famouser for sausages than songs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seldom turns a poet out like Hudson that can chant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well as make such ditties as the Free and Easies want,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_453" id="page_453">{453}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or other Tavern Melodists I can’t just call to mind&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it’s not the classic system for to propagate the kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereby it so may happen as that neither of them Scholars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be the proper Chairman for the Glorious Apollers!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For my part in the matter, if so be I had a voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s the best among the vocalists I’d honour with the choice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a Poet as could furnish a new Ballad to the bunch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or at any rate the surest hand at mixing of the punch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cause why, the members meet for that and other tuneful frolics&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not to say, like Muffincaps, their Catichiz and Collec’s.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you see them there Itinerants that preach so long and loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And always takes advantage like the prigs of any crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have brought their jangling voices, as far as they can compass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have turn’d a tavern shindy to a seriouser rumpus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him as knows most hymns&mdash;altho’ I can’t see how it follers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They want to be the Chairman of the Glorious Apollers!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, that’s the row&mdash;and who can guess the upshot after all?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether Harmony will ever make the “Arms” her House of call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or whether this here mobbing&mdash;as some longish heads foretel it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will grow to such a riot that the Oxford Blues must quell it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howsomever, for the present, there’s no sign of any peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the hubbub keeps a growing, and defies the New Police;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if <i>I</i> was in the Vestry, and a leading sort of Man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a Member of the Vocals, to get backers for my plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, I’d settle all the squabble in the twinkle of a needle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I’d have another candidate&mdash;and that’s the Parish Beadle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who makes such lots of Poetry, himself, or else by proxy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no one never has no doubts about his orthodoxy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereby&mdash;if folks was wise&mdash;instead of either of them Scholars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straining their own lungs along of contradictious hollers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’ll lend their ears to reason, and take my advice as follers,<br /></span>

<span class="ih">As ever lived&mdash;at least at number Four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Austin Friars, in Mrs. Brown’s first floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At fifty pounds,&mdash;or thereabouts,&mdash;per ann.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lady reckon’d him her best of lodgers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rent so punctually paid each quarter,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did not smoke like nasty foreign codgers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor play French horns like Mr. Rogers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or talk his flirting nonsense to her daughter&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that the girl was light behaved or courtable&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still on one failing tenderly to touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gentleman did like a drop too much,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">(Tho’ there are many such)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took more Port than was exactly portable.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fact,&mdash;to put the cap upon the nipple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And try the charge,&mdash;Tom certainly <i>did</i> tipple.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought the motto was but sorry stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Cribb’s Prize Cup&mdash;Yes, wrong in ev’ry letter&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That “D&mdash;&mdash;d be he who first cries <i>Hold Enough</i>!”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The hands, o’er all, are members that make motions,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Still, still, and still, to his astonished eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One cheek was green, the other cherry ripe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plump in the nearest chair he sat him down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_459" id="page_459">{459}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">As for the public, fancy Sarcy Ned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coachman, flying, dog-like, at his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With “Ax your pardon, Sir, but if you please&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Unless it comes too high&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vere ought a fellow, now, to go to buy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The t’other half, Sir, of that ‘ere green cheese?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mind recoil’d&mdash;so he tied up his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with a raging tooth, and took to bed;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Poked, stroked, pinch’d, kneaded it&mdash;hemm’d&mdash;shook his head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took a long solemn pause the cause to seek,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then ask’d&mdash;‘twas Christmas&mdash;“Had he eaten grass,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">He could have found their remedy, and soon;<br /></span>

<span class="ih">Had chased the huge fish about Baffin’s old Bay,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Ben cut his line in a sort of a huff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As soon as his whales had brought profits enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hard by the Docks settled down for his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, true to his text, went to Wales for a wife.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A big one she was, without figure or waist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More bulky than lovely, but that was his taste;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, turn’d into oil, would have lighted a town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Would cry&mdash;till he blubber’d&mdash;about his old ship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_464" id="page_464">{464}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No craft like the Grampus could work through a floe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What knots she could run, and what tons she could stow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then that rich smell he preferr’d to the rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By just nosing the whole without holding his nose!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Ben he resolved, one fine Saturday night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A snug Arctic Circle of friends to invite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Tars in the trade, who related old tales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drank, and blew clouds that were “very like whales.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of course with their grog there was plenty of chat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of canting, and flinching, and cutting up fat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how Gun Harpoons into fashion had got,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if they were meant for the Gun-whale or not?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last they retired, and left Ben to his rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fancies cetaceous, and drink, well possess’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, lo! as he lay by his partner in bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard something blow through two holes in its head.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A start!” mutter’d Ben, in the Grampus afloat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made but one jump from the deck to the boat!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I look on that whale as already my own!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then groping about by the light of the moon,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And then made a plunge to imbed it in fat!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">The Leviathan rose in a great sheet of white,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The dental sure is transcendental;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some bit of masticating bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ought to help to clear a shelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let its proper work alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only seems to gnaw itself;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fact, of any grave attack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On victual there is little danger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis so like coming to the <i>rack</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well as going to the manger.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Old Hunks&mdash;it seemed a fit retort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of justice on his grinding ways&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessed a grinder of the sort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That troubled all his latter days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best of friends fall out, and so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His teeth had done some years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save some old stumps with ragged root,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they took turn about to shoot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he drank any chilly liquor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They made it quite a point to throb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if he warmed it on the hob,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why then they only twitched the quicker.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One tooth&mdash;I wonder such a tooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had never killed him in his youth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One tooth he had with many fangs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shot at once as many pangs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It had an universal sting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One touch of that ecstatic stump<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could jerk his limbs, and make him jump,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_505" id="page_505">{505}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just like a puppet on a string;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what was worse than all, it had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A way of making others bad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is, as many know, a knack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With certain farming undertakers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this same tooth pursued their track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By adding <i>achers</i> still to <i>achers</i>!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One way there is, that has been judged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A certain cure, but Hunks was loth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pay the fee, and quite begrudged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lose his tooth and money both;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fact, a dentist and the wheel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Fortune are a kindred cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For after all is drawn, you feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s paying for a blank at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Hunks went on from week to week,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kept his torment in his cheek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! how it sometimes set him rocking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that perpetual gnaw&mdash;gnaw&mdash;gnaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His moans and groans were truly shocking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loud,&mdash;altho’ he held his jaw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a tug he gave his gum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tooth, but still it would not come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ tied by string to some firm thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could not draw it, do his best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By draw’rs, although he tried a chest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last, but after much debating,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He joined a score of mouths in waiting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like his, to have their troubles out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad sight it was to look about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At twenty faces making faces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a rampant trick and antic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all were very horrid cases,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made their owners nearly frantic.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little wicket now and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took one of these unhappy men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out again the victim rushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While eyes and mouth together gushed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last arrived our hero’s turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_506" id="page_506">{506}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who plunged his hands in both his pockets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down he sat, prepared to learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How teeth are charmed to quit their sockets.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those who have felt such operations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone can guess the sort of ache,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his old tooth began to break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thread of old associations;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It touched a string in every part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It had so many tender ties;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One chord seemed wrenching at his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two were tugging at his eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Bone of his bone,” he felt of course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As husbands do in such divorce;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the fangs gave way a little<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunks gave his head a backward jerk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to! the cause of all this work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went&mdash;where it used to send his victual!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The monstrous pain of this proceeding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not so numbed his miser wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in this slip he saw a hit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save, at least, his purse from bleeding;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So when the dentist sought his fees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth Hunks, “Let’s finish, if you please.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How, finish! why it’s out!”&mdash;“Oh! no&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’m none of your before-hand tippers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis you are out, to argue so;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My tooth is in my head no doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as you say you pulled it out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of course it’s there&mdash;between your nippers.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Zounds! sir, d’ye think I’d sell the truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get a fee? no, wretch, I scorn it.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hunks still asked to see the tooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swore by gum! he had not drawn it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His end obtained, he took his leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A secret chuckle in his sleeve;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joke was worthy to produce one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think, by favour of his wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How well a dentist had been bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_507" id="page_507">{507}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By one old stump, and that a loose one!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thing was worth a laugh, but mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is still the frailest thing on earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! how often when a joke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems in our sleeve, and safe enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There comes some unexpected stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hangs a weeper on the cuff!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hunks had not whistled half a mile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, planted right against the stile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stood his foeman, Mike Maloney,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vagrant reaper, Irish-born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That helped to reap our miser’s corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But had not helped to reap his money,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fact that Hunks remembered quickly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His whistle all at once was quelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he saw how Michael held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sickle, he felt rather sickly.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nine souls in ten, with half his fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would soon have paid the bill at sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But misers (let observers watch it)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will never part with their delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till well demanded by a hatchet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They live hard&mdash;and they die to match it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Hunks, prepared for Mike’s attacking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved not yet to pay the debt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let him take it out in hacking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However, Mike began to stickle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In word before he used the sickle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mercy was not long attendant:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From words at last he took to blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aimed a cut at Hunks’s nose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made it what some folks are not&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Member very independent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heaven knows how far this cruel trick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might still have led, but for a tramper<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That came in danger’s very nick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To put Maloney to the scamper.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still compassion met a damper;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_508" id="page_508">{508}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lay the severed nose, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the daisies on the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Wee, crimson-tipt” as well as they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">According to the poet’s lay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there stood Hunks, no sight for laughter!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away ran Hodge to get assistance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nose in hand, which Hunks ran after,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But somewhat at unusual distance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many a little country place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a very common case<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have but one residing doctor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose practice rather seems to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No practice, but a rule of three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Physician&mdash;surgeon&mdash;drug-decocter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Hunks was forced to go once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he had ta’en his tooth before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mere name made the learnëd man hot&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“What! Hunks again within my door!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll pull his nose;” quoth Hunks, “you cannot.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The doctor looked and saw the case<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plain as the nose <i>not</i> on his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“O! hum&mdash;ha&mdash;yes&mdash;I understand.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then arose a long demur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not a finger would he stir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he was paid his fee in hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That matter settled, there they were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Hunks well strapped upon his chair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The opening of a surgeon’s job&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tools, a chestful or a drawful&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And give the heart the strangest throb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never patient in his funks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked half so like a ghost as Hunks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or surgeon half so like a devil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared for some infernal revel:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His huge black eye kept rolling, rolling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just like a bolus in a box:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fury seemed above controlling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bellowed like a hunted ox:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_509" id="page_509">{509}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Now, swindling wretch, I’ll show thee how<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh! sweet is this revenge to sup;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have thee by the nose&mdash;it’s now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My turn&mdash;and I will turn it up.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Guess how the miser liked the scurvy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cruel way of venting passion;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The snubbing folks in this new fashion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed quite to turn him topsy turvy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He uttered prayers, and groans, and curses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For things had often gone amiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrong with him before, but this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would be the worst of all <i>reverses</i>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fancy he beheld his snout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned upward like a pitcher’s spout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was another grievance yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fancy did not fail to show it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he must throw a summerset,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or stand upon his head to blow it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And was there then no argument<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To change the doctor’s vile intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And move his pity?&mdash;yes, in truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that was&mdash;paying for the tooth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Zounds! pay for such a stump! I’d rather&mdash;”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here the menace went no farther,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For with his other ways of pinching,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunks had a miser’s love of snuff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A recollection strong enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cause a very serious flinching;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In short he paid and had the feature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replaced as it was meant by nature;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For tho’ by this ’twas cold to handle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(No corpse’s could have felt more horrid,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And white just like an end of candle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doctor deemed and proved it too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That noses from the nose will do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well as noses from the forehead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, fixed by dint of rag and lint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The part was bandaged up and muffled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_510" id="page_510">{510}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chair unfastened, Hunks arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shuffled out, for once unshuffled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he went, these words he snuffled&mdash;<br /></span>

width="50" /></span>T was July the First, and the great hill of Howth<br /></span>
<span class="ih">Was bearing by compass sow-west and by south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the name of the ship was the Peggy of Cork,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well freighted with bacon and butter and pork.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, this ship had a captain, Macmorris by name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little O’Patrick was mate of the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Bristol they sailed, but by nautical scope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They contrived to be lost by the Cape of Good Hope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the Cork boys that the vessel could boast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_513" id="page_513">{513}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only little O’P. made a swim to the coast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he revived from a sort of a trance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw a big Black with a very long lance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says the savage, says he, in some Hottentot tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Bash Kuku my gimmel bo gumborry bung!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then blew a long shell, to the fright of our elf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down came a hundred as black as himself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They brought with them <i>guattul</i>, and pieces of <i>klam</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first was like beef, and the second like lamb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Don’t I know,” said O’P., “what the wretches are at?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’re intending to eat me as soon as I’m fat!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In terror of coming to pan, spit, or pot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rations of <i>jarbul</i> he suffered to rot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not touch <i>purry</i> or <i>doolberry-lik</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But kept himself <i>growing</i> as thin as a stick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though broiling the climate, and parching with drouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not let <i>chobbery</i> enter his mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But kicked down the <i>krug</i> shell, tho’ sweetened with <i>natt</i>,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I an’t to be pisoned the likes of a rat!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the great <i>Joddry</i> got quite in a rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, “O mi pitticum dambally nage!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>chobbery</i> take, and put back on the shelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or give me the <i>krug</i> shell, I’ll drink it myself!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>doolberry-lik</i> is the best to be had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the <i>purry</i> (I chewed it myself) is not bad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>jarbul</i> is fresh, for I saw it cut out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the <i>Bok</i> that it came from is grazing about.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My <i>jumbo</i>! but run off to Billery Nang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell her to put on her <i>jigger</i> and <i>tang</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And go with the <i>Bloss</i> to the man of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And say that she comes as his <i>Wulwul</i> from me.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Billery Nang was as Black as a sweep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thick curly hair like the wool of a sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moment he spied her, said little O’P.,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Sure the Divil is dead, and his Widow’s at me!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when, in the blaze of her Hottentot charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She came to accept him for life in her arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stretched her thick lips to a broad grin of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Raven preparing to bill like a Dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a soul full of dread he declined the grim bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stopped her Molyneux arms, and eluded her kiss;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_514" id="page_514">{514}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, fairly foiled, she gave up the attack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>Joddry</i> began to look blacker than black;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“By Mumbo! by Jumbo!&mdash;why here is a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That won’t be made happy, do all that I can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He will not be married, lodged, clad, and well fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the <i>Rham</i> take his <i>shangwang</i> and chop off his head!”<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
